# BULL Portfolio State

> **Rebuilt each wake** from `trade_log.md` by whichever routine is running.
> `trade_log.md` is the source of truth; this file is a derived snapshot.
> **Last rebuild:** 2026-06-02T04:11Z routine-03-eod (Mon on-time 21:00 PT cron). Book still flat (XRP closed 2026-05-30T23:00:00Z, −$101.40 / −0.65R) → no MTM, no exit checks possible. Equity unchanged at $10,254.63. **Regime slipped since midday**: 24h breadth **3/15 positive** (HYPE +0.95%, NEAR +2.86%, TAO +0.08%); median **−0.95%**. **Rule 5a now FAILS** (3 = floor−1; oscillated FAIL→PASS→FAIL across 3 wakes today). **5a-SBD NOT triggered** (3 > 1-positive ceiling and median −0.95% > −1.0% threshold). No entries opened (regime gate blocked all 15 pairs); no exits required (book flat). 0 OPEN, 0 CLOSE this wake. Day PnL $0 / 0.00%. Trades today: 0 opened, 0 closed. NEAR remains the standout positive-momentum pair (+2.86% 24h, would have been rule-8 highest-ranked candidate among positive-breadth pairs). Kill switches all clear (DD 4.42%, equity $10,254.63 > $7,500 floor, daily PnL $0, loss-streak 4 unchanged). Kraken MCP returned 15/15 cleanly. Telegram: EOD card sent per routine #3 mandatory daily card requirement.

Portfolio risk-at-moment: **0.00%** of equity (cap 4%).
Open positions: **0 / 8** (strategy v0.4 max-concurrent 4 → 0/4 used; cluster {BTC,ETH,SOL,TAO,AVAX,SUI,LINK} 0/2).

## Active kill-switch state

- Daily realized on 2026-06-01 PT trading day: **$0.00** (no closes today; XRP exit was 2026-05-30 PT) — clear vs 5% loss cap.
- Consecutive losing trading days: 05-22 L, 05-25 L, 05-26 L, 05-30 L (05-27/28/29/31 no-realized-PnL → streak unchanged) → streak **4** (cap 7; warn at 5 informally — still 1 day from informal warn).
- Max drawdown: **4.42%** from peak $10,728.95 (cap 25%, warn 12.5%) — clear.
- Equity floor: $10,254.63 > $7,500 floor — OK.
- Regime gate (rule 5a) **FAILS** (3/15 positive < 4 floor; slipped from 4/15 PASS at midday 20:07Z as XDG turned negative). **5a-SBD not triggered** (3 > 1-positive ceiling, median −0.95% > −1.0%). New entries blocked this wake.
- No active 5b cooldowns (XRP 2026-05-30 exit was ema20-confirm, not stop-hit — rule 5b inapplicable; >24h elapsed anyway).
- **All clear (kill switches). Entries blocked by 5a (not a kill switch — rule-driven skip).** routine-03-eod 2026-06-02T04:11Z: **0 OPEN, 0 CLOSE** (book flat → no MTM/exit; 5a blocked entry scan). Next wake: routine-01-overnight 2026-06-02T15:00Z (Tue 08:00 PT scheduled).
