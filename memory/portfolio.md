# BULL Portfolio State

> **Rebuilt each wake** from `trade_log.md` by whichever routine is running.
> `trade_log.md` is the source of truth; this file is a derived snapshot.
> **Last rebuild:** 2026-06-01T20:07Z routine-02-midday (Mon on-time 13:00 PT cron). Book still flat (XRP closed 2026-05-30T23:00:00Z, −$101.40 / −0.65R) → no MTM, no exit checks, no entries (midday forbids by design). Equity unchanged at $10,254.63. **Regime recovered since overnight wake**: 24h breadth **4/15 positive** (HYPE +1.65%, NEAR +11.61%, TAO +0.26%, XDG +0.10%); median **−1.55%**. **Rule 5a now PASSES** (4 = floor exactly; recovered from 0/15 FAIL at 15:50Z). **SBD CLEARED** (4 > 1-positive ceiling). SBD episode duration ~4h (15:50Z → 20:07Z) with book flat throughout → cumulative SBD value-add = $0. NEAR +11.61% is the standout move (universe addition justified day-1). 0 OPEN, 0 CLOSE this wake. Kill switches all clear (DD 4.42%, equity $10,254.63 > $7,500 floor, daily PnL $0, loss-streak 4). Kraken MCP returned 15/15 cleanly. Telegram silent (no anomaly).

## Open positions

_(none — book flat since XRP/USD exit 2026-05-30T23:00:00Z)_

Portfolio risk-at-moment: **0.00%** of equity (cap 4%).
Open positions: **0 / 8** (strategy v0.4 max-concurrent 4 → 0/4 used; cluster {BTC,ETH,SOL,TAO,AVAX,SUI,LINK} 0/2).

## Active kill-switch state

- Daily realized on 2026-06-01 PT trading day: **$0.00** (no closes today; XRP exit was 2026-05-30 PT) — clear vs 5% loss cap.
- Consecutive losing trading days: 05-22 L, 05-25 L, 05-26 L, 05-30 L (05-27/28/29/31 no-realized-PnL → streak unchanged) → streak **4** (cap 7; warn at 5 informally — still 1 day from informal warn).
- Max drawdown: **4.42%** from peak $10,728.95 (cap 25%, warn 12.5%) — clear.
- Equity floor: $10,254.63 > $7,500 floor — OK.
- Regime gate (rule 5a) **PASSES** (4/15 positive = 4 floor exactly; recovered from 0/15 FAIL at overnight wake 15:50Z). **SBD CLEARED** (4 > 1-positive ceiling; episode duration ~4h with book flat). Entries re-authorized from regime perspective — but midday routine forbids entries by design; next entry-eligible wake = routine-03-eod 2026-06-01T21:00 PT.
- No active 5b cooldowns (XRP 2026-05-30 exit was ema20-confirm, not stop-hit — rule 5b inapplicable; >24h elapsed anyway).
- **All clear (kill switches). Trading authorized.** routine-02-midday 2026-06-01T20:07Z: **0 OPEN, 0 CLOSE** (midday is position-management only; book flat → no MTM/exit). Next wake: routine-03-eod 2026-06-02T04:00Z (Mon 21:00 PT scheduled).
